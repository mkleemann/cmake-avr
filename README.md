## cmake-avr - a cmake toolchain for AVR projects

### Supports
- build
- upload
- disassembly

### Installation
- run install.sh with sudo
- copy sample in your porject folder
- adjust it to your project
- use

### Testing the example provided

The toolchain was created and tested within the following environment:

Linux
* Arch Linux with kernel 3.12.5-1-ARCH up to 3.16.2-1-ARCH
* cmake version 2.8.12.1 - 3.0.2
* GNU Make 4.0
* avr-gcc (GCC) 4.8.2 - 4.9.1
* avr-binutils 2.23.2-1 - 2.24-2
* avr-libc 1.8.0-5 - 1.8.1-1
* git version 1.8.5.2 - 2.1.0

Windows XP
* cmake version 2.8.10.2
* GNU Make 3.81
* avr-gcc (AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.4.1_798) 4.6.2 (Atmel Studio 6)
* avr-binutils AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.4.1_798 (Atmel Studio 6)
* avr-libc AVR_8_bit_GNU_Toolchain_3.4.1_798 (Atmel Studio 6)
* git version 1.7.11.msysgit.1

Windows 7
* cmake 3.0.2
* Atmel Studio 6.2
* git 1.9.0.msysgit

OS X
* OS X 10.10 with AVR toolchain installed from [macports](http://macports.org)
* cmake 3.0.2
* GNU Make 3.81
* avr-gcc 4.9.1
* avr-libc 1.8.1
* avr-binutils 2.24_1
* git version 2.1.2

**Note:**
If building in a Windows environment, you need to extent the values of the
environment variable `PATH` to the location of the binaries, especially to
find `make`. To enable a more general approach to different Windows toolchains,
the variable `AVR_FIND_ROOT_PATH` needs to be defined. Tested was it with the
following setup (XP):

```bash
PATH=...;d:/Program Files/Atmel/Atmel Studio 6.0/extensions/Atmel/AVRGCC/3.4.1.81/AVRToolchain/bin;...
AVR_FIND_ROOT_PATH="d:/Program Files/Atmel/Atmel Studio 6.0/extensions/Atmel/AVRGCC/3.4.1.81/AVRToolchain/avr"
```
**Issue within Windows 7 environment**
With Windows 7 (64bit) and the Atmel Studio 6.2 setup, `make.exe` now resides
differently. It also crashes during the cmake generation process, just after the
simple examples to test the compiler (try_compile(...)) ran through. The why and
avoidance of this is currently unknown to me. I didn't try to use a `cygwin make` as
a substitute yet.

After getting the project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mkleemann/cmake-avr.git /path/to/clone/in
```

you just need to run the following commands

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/some/build/dir
cd /path/to/some/build/dir
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/clone/in/generic-gcc-avr.cmake /path/to/clone/in/example
make
```

For Windows use:
```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/clone/in/generic-gcc-avr.cmake /path/to/clone/in/example
```

This just creates the example, but does not upload it. For all possible targets, you need to run

```bash
make help
```

after running the `cmake` command.

### ToDo

- [X] option for target name attachments with MCU type (option -DWITH_MCU=ON (default))
- [X] usage of target names w/o extension for avr_target_link_libraries command
- [X] cleanup baudrate and other AVRDUDE settings
- [X] test in Windows environment
- [X] use add_definition() instead of variables for compiler settings
- [X] some more tests with upload and fuses
